gb-coding-extension
===================

An extension for Visual Studio that spell checks your code.
This is because i'm sick of finding silly spelling mistakes in variable names, class names and method names.

Created quite a while ago, and just now ported from http://code.google.com
Here's a link to my <a href="http://debuggerstepthrough.blogspot.co.il/2012/02/vs-spell-check-extension-using-roslyn.html">blog post</a> about this.

(Don't take this too seriously, it was just a hack created by me to test the new 'Roslyn' feature from Microsoft)
